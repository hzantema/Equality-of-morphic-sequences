
This repository consists of all files for proving equality of morphic sequences, as described in the paper 
"Equality of morphic sequences" by Hans Zantema on Arxiv.

It contains the source code of three programs eq.p, eql.p and eqb.p, written in FreePascal. 
Also the Windows executables are available. 
As FreePascal is open source, the source code may be compiled for other platforms for free.

Apart from the programs several example files are included. 
They may serve as input for the programs, but also contain the output of the programs: proofs that the encoded morphic sequeunces are equal. 
For instance, by running "eq < ex1.txt" a proof is generated that the corresponding morphic sequences are equal, which is also part of the file ex1.txt.
The format of the input is explained in the above mentioned paper.

The programs and examples are developed by Hans Zantema in 2024.
